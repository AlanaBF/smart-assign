# Smart-Assign (Frontend)

This folder contains the standalone Angular frontend for the Smart-Assign project.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd angular-frontend/smart-assign
npm install
```

2. Run the development server (opens at `http://localhost:4200` by default):

```bash
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the frontend can't fetch candidates, confirm the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000` and CORS is configured to allow `http://localhost:4200`.
